# QuotesWithoutExpo

It is a mobile application that displays quotes. If you scroll down the screen, the quote will be refreshed as you can see in the second picture, and the "Change The Quote" button that you can see at the bottom of the page also has the same function.

## Development Process

My main aim was developing a component based application. In this way I could have more readable codebase and it would be easier if I had to expand the project by adding new features in the future.

I used [Quotable](https://opensourcelibs.com/lib/quotable) for data. It's easy to use and it has a explanatory documentation. 

## Getting Started

In your terminal change into project folder that you created then run:
```bash
yarn install
```
to install required dependencies.

After installing run :
```bash
yarn react-native start
```
This starts Metro Bundler.

After that, open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder and run :
```bash
yarn react-native run-android
```
